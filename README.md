# CQRS

This project was created to practice CQRS implementation. It uses Kafka as a message broker. As it was created only as an exercise it is simple. It has a producer from where data is sent to a message broker (Kafka) and also has a consumer where data is modified and becomes read to be stored in a NoSQL database (MongoDB). After, the user can read data from the database using an API, queries can be done by using the student email or not, the later method will retrieve all data from the database.

## Endpoints documentation

        ],
        "totalSpentInBooks": 6000,
        "created": "2022-05-06T03:39:33.097"
    }

    }
```

### Consumer (Kafka-consumer)

> No endpoints are present for this application

Here data is treated before getting stored in database.

Example of the data after being treated by the consumer application and be stored in database.

```sh  
    {
        _id: ObjectId('6274c2a53683033f2e7bd22a'),
        firstName: 'StudentName',
        lastName: 'StudentSurname',
        email: 'surname@xxxx.com',
        gender: 'MALE',
        address: {
            country: 'England',
            city: 'London',
            postCode: '5211'
        },
        favouriteSubjects: [
            'Mathematics',
            'Physics',
            'Computer Science',
            'Cybersecurity'
        ],
        totalSpentInBooks: '6000',
        created: ISODate('2022-05-06T06:39:33.097Z'),
        _class: 'com.vieira.sogolon.consumer.model.Student'
